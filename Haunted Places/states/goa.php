                <p>A haunted church might sound like an oxymoron but holds true if you believe in the story that surrounds the Three Kings Church Goa.  Locals and visitors to the church have reported hearing strange noises and "a strange, ominous presence" in and around the church. While the church precincts make for a perfect sunset point, most of the crowd disperses by late noon because of the horror tales that are associated with it.

                <p>This hotel never got its name since it was never completely built. The abandoned hotel which was being built by the Russians never got completed due to legal hassles. However, the unfinished hotel and the surrounding area full of wild trees and bushes certainly make it quite a spooky place. The hotel has come to be known as the Ghost Hotel after few people claiming to have experienced and witnessed some paranormal activities around the place.

Well, it is quite an unnerving experience and stopping midway and checking to find that there is no one can make any brave heart nervous.
