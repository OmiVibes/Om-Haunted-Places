                <p>Charleville Mansion is a century-old deserted castle, built in the British era. Located up the lush green hills of Shimla, it was once, home of a British officer Victor Bayley and his wife. Prior to them, an army officer resided in the mansion. Both the families have reported uncanny incidents inside the house like sighting a British gentleman who slowly disappears, breaking and crashing things in the house. The activities are quite violent and disturbing.

                <p>There is one story around Friday, the 13, when a headless horseman appears and offers a rose to one of the girls. He takes along ones who agree and kills those who don’t. Another folklore talks of a fire in the CJM’s dormitory for orphans during British rule. The current play area is where the kids were buried. Of many ghost mentions, there is a young girl who keeps asking for her doll, and other young women who were taken by the horseman.

                <p>Indira Gandhi Medical College is the largest medical set up in not only Shimla but whole of Himachal Pradesh. Besides weird noises and strange voices, some have also reported being pushing from behind while taking the stairs. Common belief is that all these activities are due to the presence of spirits of the people who have died in the hospital. Even the forest road near the college is said to be spooked by the ghost of an orange seller.

                <p>A spooky occurrence, narrated by Sir John Smith—one of the guests at Dukhani, when the place was owned by an old Britisher Bucky—is the most popular haunted tale of this house. During a short stay at Dukhani, Sir John Smith encountered the ghost of the old man in a gown, in the very same room where he had shot himself. Having said that this is one of the most rated horror places in Shimla.

                <p>Another one of the most famous haunted places in Shimla, Chudail Baudi lies between the way to Chotta Shimla from Shimla Highway. It is believed that your car speed will automatically reduce while you are crossing this point and the evil doesn’t end here. You will be stopped by an old woman and like movies, she will ask for a lift. The only difference is that whether you say yes or no, she will be sitting on the seat right beside you. A lot of accidents take place at this spot.

                <p>Kingal is a village in Shimla district and while driving on the road at night, locals have seen weird lights on it. Nobody has a valid reason for the lights but the locals believe that it is because of some supernatural occurrence. While you are in Shimla be cautious and don’t cross this road at night. If you want to have an encounter with the supernatural forces then you may visit it.

                <p>A number of incidents have been reported at this place as it also leads the tourist to leave the place at that very moment. Gosh! The experience is too scary I guess. People complained about the ghost and spirits roaming. They have also encountered the noise that they hear and also the cries of people. Local authorities have abandoned going to the graveyard after sunset as it also leads to the death or heart attacks.

                <p>From Manali, there is just a half an hour drive to Naggar road which is quite a pretty place. Nagar has a number of resorts and a beautiful Castle is present there which was built in the British era where kinds and queens were present. In the late evening, there are unusual activities. People hear different voices of people like talking or movement and this is actually something unusual. Though these spirits don't harm people it is scary.

                <p>There is a famous jail built by the British and the prisoners were tortured and punished very brutally. The graveyards are still in work and during night paranormal activities are observed in graveyards also it is the most common locally experienced story that you may also hear the voice of falling droplets near the graveyard and this is blood droplets and if the night is more unfortunate to you, you may see bloodstains in these graveyards.

                <p>Nurpur fort is not the only last relic of the glorious past of Kangra but it also reminds of mythical dancer Noori whose names are an imitation of Noorjhan. This incident also leads to confrontation between Noorjhan and Jahangir relationship forever and left the fort deserted and destroyed the peace of the fort. This leads to Noori’s spirit stuck in the fort and locals can still hear her screaming during the night and even the sound of her anklets.
