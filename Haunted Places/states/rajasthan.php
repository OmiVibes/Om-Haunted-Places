                <p>Bhangarh Fort, one of the most horror places in Rajasthan, does not need any introduction. Counted among the most haunted places in Rajasthan, Bhangarh Fort is a famous tourist place which will spook the hell out of you! The fort is the spot for encountering incidents like a ghost of the tantric shouting, a woman crying for help, and the clinking sound of the bangles.

                <p>This formidable and one of the most haunted villages in Rajasthan has a strange story that no nobody believes in. Kuldhara is a deserted land because of the curse that an immoral minister has got in his time. This terribly haunted place of Rajasthan was checked by the paranormal society of New Delhi. Most of the stories that people say is true for the curse that roams around. Detectors and the ghost-box have recorded voices of the dead villagers and they have even revealed their names.

                <p>Nahargarh Fort stands at the edge of the Aravalli hills, overlooking the pink city of Jaipur. The walls of the fort were built sky high to disconnect the royals from the world. There’s always a need to renovate the older buildings to preserve it for future generation. It is said that the owner of that restoration organization was found dead mysteriously in his house.

                <p>The Rana Kumbha Palace of Chittorgarh is a place where you will definitely meet a ghost. A haunted fort in Rajasthan, this spot is considered to be one of the scariest places in the state. Around a year back a group of friends stayed back one night at the palace to observe if there were any paranormal activities happening. While exploring the passages, one of them heard a voice asking for help. Shocked and frightened as they turned around, they saw a lady standing in royal attire with a burnt face!

                <p>Famed as the road that asks for blood, the Ajmer-Udaipur highway is one of the most haunted places in Udaipur, Rajasthan. While driving down the Ajmer-Udaipur highway, three friends encountered the ghost of a lady carrying a baby in her arms. She sat at the back seat and guided them out of the village. Thinking it might be a nightmare, the friends took it lightly but the incident lasted for more than 15 minutes which still haunts them!

                <p>Next, on our list of haunted places in Kota, Rajasthan is the Brij Raj Bhavan. The majestic mansion is now a heritage hotel which is haunted by the spirit of an English soldier. Queen of Kota conquered the palace after Major Burton was killed by the army. Apparently, Queen of Kota spoke to the journalists claiming to have seen the ghost of dead Major Burton. The spirit is harmless and causes no physical damage to the fort. However, the ghost of Burton has a habit of hitting the dozing security guards.

                <p>Beyond the beautiful palaces of Rajasthan, this tourist place has a haunted vibe attached to it. This is because the uncanny place is a residential area where people actually live with the witches. The people living in the residential area have seen witches walking around the roads of Jagatpura. These witches look the same as in classic Indian horror tales-white dress, old, grey hair hanging loosely over the face. It is quite an eerie experience to walk after night here.

                <p>Jal Mahal, the beautiful water palace in Jaipur, has always been a topic of wonder and admiration. The 5-storey palace is built in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake and has its 4-stories submerged in the water. It is said that no one goes to this place after dark as people have heard strange screams from the palace.

                <p>Highways have always been negatively popular for ghost stories. The very commonly accessed Delhi Jaipur Highway is no immune to this. It is said that the highway gets haunted at night and people passing through this road have had some similar experiences. Many have reported of either spotting her wearing a red sari and bangles or hearing the unusual sound of the tinkling of anklets.

                <p>Sudhabay, located on the Pushkar bypass in Rajasthan is not really a haunted place. But if you come here on a specific day in the year, this place is surely going to give you nightmares. A ‘Ghost Fair’ is held here, every year, when people from different parts of the state come to get rid of the evil spirits that have possessed them. The sight of mass exorcism will give you chills, so visit this place only if you are brave at heart.

                <p>Chand Baori, a stepwell in the village of Abhaneri, Rajasthan, is a great piece of architecture. Nonetheless, its reputation as one of the most haunted places in Rajasthan attracts more eyeballs. Believed to be the world’s deepest stepwell, Chand Baori, as the locals say, was built by ghosts in one night! While you might not find a djinn lurking in the many shadows here, droves of bats, pigeons and voices that echo loud are enough to make anyone jump out of their skin.
