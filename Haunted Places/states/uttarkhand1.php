                <p>Considered as one of the most haunted places in Uttarakhand, Lambi Dehar Mines is located in Mussoorie. Slight miscalculation took the lives of a whopping 50,000 workers. They kept on digging lime in the suffocating atmosphere and started coughing blood which choked them to death. The mine was shut down after this blood-curdling incident and locals abandoned the area and moved on. The cries of those workers are still heard late at night. Moreover, it is believed that a witch still holds the place and roams around.

                <p>Situated in the Champawat district of Uttarakhand, Lohaghat has one of the most terrifying places in India. The Abbey bungalow, perched on Abbott hill, is known to be the scariest place in Uttarakhand. People living around it have heard scary noises and are afraid to go in the bungalow. Whenever a new patient was admitted in the hospital, he used to act like God and predict on which day he/she was going to die. The spookiest part of this was that the patient used to die on the exact same time and day.

                <p>Can you recall where have you heard about Pari Tibba before? No? Aren’t you a Ruskin Bond fan? Well, Ruskin Bond, the famous writer in Mussoorie, has mentioned about Pari Tibba in many of his stories.  It is believed that two lovers died at this spot when lightning struck them. After a few days, their scorched bodies were recovered but their spirits continued to wander in the woods.

                <p>Constructed in 1825, Mullingar Mansion is the oldest building in the area built by Captain Young, an Irishman commander of the first Sirmoor Battalion. After retiring from his services, he abandoned from the exuberant mansion and left for Ireland. But did he actually leave? Stated by the local lore, the building is haunted by Captain Young’s spirit. They have witnessed a rider on the grounds of this mansion. Once built with love, the place is lifeless and left to rot. Some do not believe this story but the ones who do keep this place at bay.

                <p>Perched on the majestic mountains, a haunted house in Sister’s Bazaar is one of the best haunted places in Uttarakhand which is shunned but the people living nearby. The place is an isolated forest area which is famous for its mesmerizing walking trail and enchanting views of the mountains. This forsaken haunted house was one of the parts of a colonial bungalow. The place is still visited by trekkers and people looking for party spots just for the beauty of the trail. But not even a single person dares to go to this place after moonrise.
