                <p>Shaniwarwada is a historical fort situated inside the boundaries of the city of Pune in Maharashtra. It was built around the year 1732 and remained the seat of the Peshwas right until 1818 when the Peshwas lost to the British in the Third Anglo-Maratha war. Legend has it that if you were to walk around the fort at a full moon night, you could still hear the cries of the Peshwa, calling for help, saying ‘Kaka mala vachva’ or ‘Uncle, save me!’

People have reported having seen the girl roaming the neighborhood wearing a frock, carrying a doll in her hand. Some have also said that they saw the girl coming towards them, screaming as it ran!

In several instances, people have reportedly seen the spirits of Maratha warriors who lost their lives fighting for the kingdom. Another common apparition is that of a man clad in all white keeps jumping off the cliff.

                <p>Holkar Bridge can easily be considered one of the most haunted places in Pune and the stories of it being spooked has been around even before India’s partition. The bridge was constructed in the 1800s by Madharao Peshwa and was named after Yashwantrao Holkar who is believed to have pitched his tents under the bridge several times. The abnormally high number of accidental deaths on the bridge and the fact that there is a cemetery underneath the bridge, contribute to people’s belief that the bridge is haunted.

A couple, followed by their children, and an old man jumped from the 8th level in consecutive years.
