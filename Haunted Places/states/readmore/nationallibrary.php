        <p>The National Library of India is a library located in Belvedere Estate, Alipore, Kolkata, India.[3] It is
            India's largest library by volume and public record.[4][5][6] The National Library is under Ministry of
            Culture, Government of India. Currently, Dr. Prof. Ajay Pratap Singh working as Director General
            (additional) who is Director General of Raja Ram Mohan Roy Library Foundation, Kolkata since 2020. The
            library is designated to collect, disseminate and preserve printed material produced within India. With a
            collection in excess of 2.5 million books and records, it is the largest in the country.[7] In the early
            days of British rule, it was the residence of the Governor General of Bengal and India. Later on, it became
            the residence of the Lt. Governor of Bengal, when the Governor General's and later the Viceroy's residence
            moved to today's Governor House.


            The National Library is a result of the merging of the public library with the Imperial Libraryâ€”several
            government libraries. The National Library (1953), then the Imperial Library housed several foreign
            (British) and Indian titles and was open to the public.[8] It collects book, periodicals, and titles in
            virtually all the Indian languages while the special collections in the National Library of India house at
            least fifteen languages.[8] The Hindi department has books that date back all the way to the nineteenth
            century and the first ever books printed in that language. The collections break down and consist of 86,000
            maps and 3,200 manuscripts.[8]In 2010, the Ministry of Culture, the owner of the library, decided to get the
            library building restored by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). While taking stock of the library
            building, the conservation engineers discovered a previously unknown room. The secret ground-floor room,
            about 1000 sq. ft. in size, seems to have no opening of any kind.[11]

            The ASI archaeologists tried to search the first floor area (that forms the ceiling of the room) for a trap
            door, but found nothing. Since the building is of historical and cultural importance, ASI has decided to
            bore a hole through the wall instead of breaking it. There are speculations about the room being a
            punishment room used by Warren Hastings and other British officials,[12] or a place to store treasure.[11]

            In 2011, the researchers announced that the room was filled entirely with mud, probably in an effort to
            stabilize the building.[13
