            Over the generations, we’ve been listening to folklore and spooky stories and some of us can’t seem to get
            enough of them. One such story that's supposedly inspired by people’s experiences is the story of the Dwarka
            Sector 9 haunted tree.

            Proceed With Caution @ Dwarka Sector 9 | Many people have come forward with their share of stories
            surrounding the Dwarka Sector 9 Metro Station which will surely send shivers down your spine. It’s believed
            that many moons ago, a woman died on the street outside the station and her spirit has haunted the nearby
            tree ever since!

            People travelling in call centre cabs at night have experienced an energy slapping them and some have even
            seen a woman running alongside the cars. Sounds unrealistic but according to many people, this is true! The
            spirit’s motive remains a mystery till date as her cause of death is unclear.

            Would you dare to travel on this road? Let us know if you’ve ever encountered any similar incidents!

            Where | Outside Dwarka Sector 9 Metro Station
            Dwarka is one of the biggest places in Delhi and has spread in 56.48 km2 area. Dwarka has a total of 8 metro
            stations till now and one of the 8 metro stations is one known for paranormal activities. Metro Station of
            Dwarka sector 9 is on the same road that is notorious for a white saree woman slapping people passing by.
            This road has one Temple and in front of that temple, there is a peepal tree that known to be a house of
            lady ghost.
            In Hindu mythology, Peepal or Bargad trees (Ficus religiosa & banyan tree) are known to be a place for
            chudails, aatma, ghost or anything paranormal. The main haunted ghost road of Dwarka sector 9 too has both
            trees as can be seen in below picture. This makes things spooky here. This haunted tree is in front of Dada
            Bai Wala Mandir that can be shown on googlemaps if you search for Dwarka sector 9 on map.
