        <p>Mumbai, the financial hub of India and on several travelers’ wishlist has many unique things to offer. From
            Bollywood homes to architectural marvels, the city is known for many things but did you know it has its fair
            share of haunted places too? From the abandoned Mukesh Mills to Aarey Milk Colony and the Bombay High Court
            and D’Souza Chawl are some of the most haunted places here. But there is one more to the list that we tell
            you about today and that is the Grand Paradi Towers in south Mumbai.

            These three iconic towers built in 1975 in Kemps Corner have been home to some of the most affluent and rich
            people of the city. From diamond merchants to businessmen, a home in these towers was one of the most
            expensive ones in the city even during that time offering an envious views. But soon, something else got
            Paradi Towers in the news. It was the suicide of an elderly couple followed by the suicide of their son and
            daughter-in-law. Very soon, these towers became infamous for the number of suicides that happened from its
            buildings.

            The Grand Paradi Towers have had close to 20 suicide cases since 1998 and the residents can’t really explain
            why this happened. There have been several instances of people jumping to their death from different floors
            of these towers but the eight floor is believed to the most haunted of them all. Seeing the rise in the
            number of suicides at these towers, their committee even organized a counselling session for its residents
            at one point to curb this. Spooky isn’t it?
