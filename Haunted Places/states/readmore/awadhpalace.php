        <p>Avadh Palace (Avadh Bunglow) was once ib a time pride for Rajkot. Situated at Kalavad road, 9 km from Rajkot
            city, the door of the actual castle is so alarming to enter. The encompassing space of the Avadh Palace is
            so calm. The spot is empty and demolished for 3 forty years. One can reach via plane as the air terminal is
            only 5 km away from the site. There is Also a rail route station a ways off of only 7 km.

            The famous Avadh Palace is a stupendous chateau. The royal residence is known to be possessed by NRI yet
            actually still not known. The spot stays possessed for years. Local people don't meander close to the spot
            for the most over-the-top awful and surprising reasons which makes the spot more creepy and crowns it a
            title in the rundown of top 10 tormented spots in Gujarat.



            The explanation of the spot being spooky is so brutal. As indicated by local people, sometime in the past a
            young lady was assaulted and fiercely killed and consumed in the structure. From that point forward her
            vindictive soul torment the castle and freezes the person who even challenges to enter it. After the sunset
            not a solitary individual even with the gathering dares to enter the chateau.
            There are no genuine encounters joined with this spot till now. The guests just asserted with regards to the
            creepy inclination which came from inside as they visit the structure. Photography is additionally permitted
            by taking authorization.

            Well it is an account of a castle which was left unused since 3 forty years because of its paranormal
            happenings there. Thus, assuming you preferred the post, if it's not too much trouble, share it and remark
            us underneath.
