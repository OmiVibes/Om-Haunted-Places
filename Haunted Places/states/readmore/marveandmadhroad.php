        <p>It is one of the most panoramic routes in the city but it is also considered as one of the most haunted
            routes. This road is covered with lush green tall trees both side and offers a beautiful ride but what
            restricts the riders to come on this route is the spirit of a bride. It is believed that the spirit of a
            bride torments the people who come on this route. Series of fatal accidents are witnessed on this route
            because of the spirit.
            Mumbai is the largest city in India, a city full of dreamers and hard- drudge. A place where you will
            encounter stray dogs and attractive birds, artists and workers, the poor and millionaires living together in
            this city. The city is the home of the most prolific of film industries one of Asia’s biggest slums
            (Dharavi), and the largest tropical forest in an urban zone. How much ever ironic it sounds, the city of
            Mumbai is extremely beautiful in its own essence. Besides, this every city has some secrets hidden in its
            history, some sweet lie or dark- bitter truth.
            Anyway, I am now collecting information on the haunting of Marve & Madh Road. The road connecting Swami
            Vivekananda road to Marve village, fresh air and mangrove trees on both sides. Just like a beautiful village
            road of my childhood. But it’s not haunted by a spirit of a lady like Marve & Madh Road does.
            This story is about 25 years ago. At this place, spirit of a lady is present. According to locals, a bride
            was badly killed on her wedding night. After that her body was dumped in the mangroves. That’s the reason
            her spirit is always seen by visitors in full bridal outfits. She distracts the visitors on the road of this
            island which is on the border of Mumbai. She yells and when someone goes to help her, she starts running
            along that person with his/her vehicle. Due to these paranormal activities many accidents take place on
            Generally she appears in full moon night. Many hotel owners heard her screams several times. This became
            part of their life. But I can't take it so lightly as its becoming evening. I had enough and decided to
            leave the road before sun downs completely.
