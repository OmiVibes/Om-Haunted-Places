        <p>Location: Chandkheda, Ahmedabad

            Chandkheda is a well-developed city in northwestern Ahmedabad and west to the Sabarmati River. But there is
            a sin story tailing this place. Chandkheda is known to be one of the most haunted places of Ahmedabad.

            The backstory about the place

            If you ask the locals, they will tell multiple stories but all of that indicates just one thing and that’s
            this place is haunted and terrorising. Some say that Britishers used this place as their body dumping ground
            and some say that the haunting of Chandkheda goes even before the Britishers came to India. There is nothing
            certain but one thing- Chandkheda is amongst the spooky places of Ahmedabad.

            Spooky things that happened here

            There is a tree in Chandkheda which is haunted by spirits. And people also say that the tree is home to many
            ghosts. The place looks very normal and like any other place during the day but it becomes totally opposite
            during the night. There are stories that Chandkheda tree should not be visited after dark because those who
            have done that get possessed. They behave differently and bad things happen to them. Luckily no one
            according to the locals have lost their life but we say you shouldn’t try to push your luck.
