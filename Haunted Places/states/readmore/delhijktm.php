            Jamail Kamali mosque, situated right next to Qutub Minar in Delhi, is a beautiful archaeological site that,
            surprisingly, rarely features in the travel bucket list of travellers.
            It's another prominent monument from the Mughal era that still stands tall amid the old ruins of Delhi, but
            has lost its lustre over the time. It occasionally manages to create some stir because of the haunting
            stories related to djinns, which people believe reside here.
            If reports are to go by, it's the very mosque that has supposedly laid the foundation for the great Mughal
            architecture style, and is believed to have also introduced the Jharokha system, which was missing from
            earlier monuments.
            Although Jamali Kamali boasts of a glorious history, the haunted stories have made it a story of the past.
            Reportedly, this site is associated with haunting stories of the past, as well as certain unexplainable
            phenomena with a number of people bearing witness to the strange happenings.
            Many people claim that there are ghosts and djinns residing at Jamali Kamali, while many have also claimed
            to have experienced sightings of lights, animals' growling, apparitions, and a feeling of someone else
            standing right next to them!
            People who have visited this place have gone on record to see that they felt that there was someone peeking
            from behind a pillar, but couldnâ€™t find anyone when they searched around. Some even added that they have
            heard sounds of laughing voices, and been slapped by invisible forces.
            However, as per the records, a security guard on duty, when questioned on this matter, added that he had
            been at the mosque, both in the day as well as night, but he never felt any paranormal activities and added
            that these are all made up stories.
            While the haunted stories might not be true, the only destruction that is apparent at the site is
            destruction caused not by ghosts but by humans, as acts of vandalism caused by people are visible all over
            the place.
            Do note that it is for this reason that the staircases as well as the tombs are now locked. Even the Friday
            prayers have been prohibited within the mosque to protect and conserve whatever is left of the once
            beautiful monument.
            It can be aptly said that the mosque does not get all the attention it deserves for all the wrong reasons.
