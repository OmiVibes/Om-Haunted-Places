        <p>Kolkata is famous as the city of Joy. But did you know Kolkata also has a dark and eerie side? Yes, you heard
            it right. If you view Kolkata through a spooky lens, the stories are unending. But there’s one that will
            send chills down your spine and make you shiver even in daylight! Have you heard of the haunted Putulbari
            dollhouse in Kolkata? Almost every local in Kolkata is aware of this spooky house of dolls. You will find
            Putul Bari adjacent to the Circular Railway track and close to the Shobhabazar jetty. The haunted dollhouse
            is located at 22 Hara Chandra Mullick Lane. And if you are brave enough to climb the stairs to the haunted
            and dark upper floors of Putul Bari, you might end up getting a Red and White Bravery Award. Read on to know
            more about the history of this haunted doll house in Kolkata
            Putul Bari is now a heritage building in Kolkata but no one is over with its ghostly past. During colonial
            rule, Putul Bari was used as a warehouse by the rich Bengali Babus who handled the British readings in the
            city. Word of mouth has it that the owner of this warehouse had a beautiful daughter who loved dolls. But
            love turned into an obsession and she covered the entire house with numerous dolls. But owing to a mishap,
            the daughter met with a tragic death and Putul Bari turned ghostly forever. Another story related to Putul
            Bari is that the babus used the warehouse to rape young women. They would later murder the women to hide
            their crime. And all this tormenting led to Putubari being haunted by the cries of those women.
            Kolkata’s Putul Bari has been haunting people for decades now. From weird sounds and unexplained events to
            rare sightings of unidentified shadows, Putul Bari is home to all the eeriness and mystery in Kolkata.
            Almost every local in Kolkata is aware of the tragic incident of Putul Bari. Even today locals report
            hearing hues and cries of female voices from the dollhouse. Totally creepy! So much so that there’s
            supposedly an award that people get if they are capable of reaching the dark upper floors of the dollhouse.
            Even though there are no facts to prove the ghostly happenings in Kolkata’s haunted dollhouse, we still
            recommend you to not try and visit Putul Bari. You never know an adventure trip to the dollhouse might turn
            out to be your greatest mistake!
