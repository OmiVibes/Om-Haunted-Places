                <p>It is said that the house or lodge was abandoned after a ritual went wrong and since then mysterious sounds can be heard coming from that house. Visitors claimed to have found some demonic symbols at different spots inside the house. According to nearby residents, crying and weird noises, screaming and other inexplicable sounds have also been heard coming from the deserted old building. And now, no one dares to explore the abandoned building after sunset.

                <p>The stories of the abnormal events state that people visiting the site during the dusk often hear a lady laughing, which is kind of spooky. But she never had been seen eye to eye. The visitors also reported hearing the sound of bamboos falling, but on investigation, they find nothing. It is not a place for spending a pleasant Sunday evening, so do not plan to go there unless you want to hear the laughing sounds of “ghosts”.

                <p>During the Assamese-Burman wars, the year 1820 saw a tragic incident in Assam. In those days, the Assamese villagers in poverty were allegedly harassed by the Burmese. Then, after placing the Assamese captives atop the banyan tree, the Burmese would set fire to the base after tying them to the tree. The tree is thought to be a gathering place for the villager’s ghosts.

                <p>t is believed that birds from several geographical locations come here not to mate, migrate or do something else but to commit suicide. For the longest time, there was a phenomenon prevalent here that was called ‘bird suicide’. The birds would fly in one direction towards the light and then drop dead. This would usually happen at the end of the monsoon months.
