                <p>So this is about an entire colony established by a Portuguese businessman De Monte if you’re looking for ghost places in Chennai. He lived an unhappy life with his mentally ill wife. His son also died under unknown circumstances. The colony is visited by Mr De Monte often. People have seen him walking under the moon, opening the locks, closing the doors and resting around on his rocking chair.

                <p>Considered to be amongst the top haunted places in Chennai, this bridge was initially built to connect fishermen to the sea. It could not stand the waves, broke down and has been left to ruin since then. A favored shooting spot in the daylight, it becomes a morning walk park for the citizens of the paranormal world. The fishermen assert that they have heard women screaming at night – women who were allegedly raped and murdered here, a few years ago.

                <p>Just a poorly lit street, housing an animal shelter, school and a temple–Besant Avenue Road is a new level of eerie if you’re looking for horror places in Chennai. It looks normal till the sun is up and obviously goes paranormal by the time moon takes up the sky. This attacking ghost seems to be a little violent as his occurrences include slapping the travellers and people walking by. He even throws people off the road and then laughs out loud. This eerie phenomenon has landed this place in the list of the top haunted places in Chennai for locals and travellers alike.

                <p>This is amongst the most haunted houses in Chennai. So this house in Valmiki Nagar on Ambedkar Road is only 15 km from Chennai airport. It is owned by the father of a woman who committed suicide in the house itself. The abode has been haunted for 10 years since her death. The ghost of the daughter has been living in the house years after her death. She opens the house for the visitors after midnight and offers all the hospitality a guest is supposed to get.

                <p>The land on which Wipro is situated used to be a graveyard in the ’80s. End of discussion now. Zoom into the image and look under the street lamp. A human figure has been spotted walking in the streets around the Wipro building in Sholinganallur. The guards have witnessed several apparitions at night.

                <p>One of the scariest places in Chennai, this locality has been one of the worst-hit Tsunami zones in 2004. Several deaths caused an upsurge of an equal number of unsatisfied sad souls in the vicinity. It has been popular that these ghosts are blood hungry and haunt the only temple in the area.

                <p>This butter smooth road is a rider’s delight during the day. Cometh the hours of the moon and this two laned road, connecting Chennai and Puducherry, turns into one of the most haunted places in Chennai. Drivers have died, passengers and pillion riders have suffered fatal injuries and what not.  There are multiple versions of the ghost on this road — a toddler, a cat, a girl and many more. All these appear as apparitions on the road causing the drivers to lose control over their vehicles.

                <p>This is just a half ready, empty building facing the Anna Flyover. The building sadly has been the suicide venue of quite a many sad souls. One of the spookiest places in Chennai, this will surely haunt you for days. People passing by have often told about strange echoing noises of laughter and cries. The nights are harrowing examples of sad darkness and chills.

                <p>So, every experience here revolves around a huge Banyan tree. A forest reserve near the Adyar River in Valmiki Nagar, the Theosophical Society is well visited during the day. After 7:00 pm is when all the drama starts around the tree.  Loud screams after sunset, and indistinct names being called out from the tree are among the most common occurrences at the haunted spot of the Theosophical Society.

                <p>This one is actually about the catharsis of refusal. So this alleged ghost that walks the corridors of Herber’s Hall at Madras Christian College got rejected by his love and committed suicide. The guy visits the hall at night and sometimes in the morning. He cries, laughs and talks to his friends. People have heard his footsteps often.
