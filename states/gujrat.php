                <p>Dumas Beach is not a place for the faint-hearted. They believe that these ghosts have unfulfilled mortal wishes and now they roam around the beach, terrorizing visitors. Many people have reported seeing mysterious things and hearing peals of laughter when here. But not everything is known about the most haunted place in Gujarat since many of these visitors have been missing since they ventured onto the beach.

                <p>Signature Farms near Ahmedabad is among the 10 most haunted places in Gujarat. The place has many broken sculptures and statues, which appear to have been sliced in half, including a statue of Buddha. Post sunset, people have heard sounds of horses galloping in their direction. The locals say that the place was the center of a mass massacre long back, and those massacred villagers are now believed to roam the area at night.

                <p>Right beside the busy by-lanes of Chandkheda, bustling with thousands of vehicles passing by every hour, there is an old tree that is the perfect image of a haunted tree. The sight of the shadow of the massive tree at night is just enough to qualify this as one of the top scary places in Ahmedabad. The locals from the area believe that this tree is possessed by a ghost. And, anyone who comes near it at night gets possessed too with crazy visions and nightmares.

                <p>The stretch between Bagodara and Limdi is believed to be haunted by the restless spirit of a woman who enjoys diverting the attention of drivers, causing accidents or even leading them to their death. Many drivers claim that this place is eerily silent and send chills down their spine. Many night-time drivers have also spotted women or beggars on the roadside who vanish when the car gets close

                <p>A tiny hamlet near Vadodara, Sindhrot has a beautiful dam that is a famous evening spot for the youth owing to the peace and fresh breeze they find here. But despite the serenity and tourism essence, this place is among the most haunted places in Vadodara Gujarat. Locals often report sighting a girl wearing a traditional Indian salwar-kameez-dupatta, but with a half face! Horrifying, right? They say she asks people to go back the way they came and warns them against entering the village with girls.

                <p>The well-known Avadh Palace is a large mansion and no one is sure who really owns it. It remains unoccupied and locals do not venture anywhere near it for the most brutal and upsetting of reasons. Locals convey that a girl was gang-raped, murdered, and burnt in this building long ago. To this day, her vengeful spirit is believed to haunt this huge mansion and terrorize anyone who dares enter it. No one visits this place once the sun sets, be it alone or with a company.

                <p>The fort is built on a plateau, right in the center of the town that attracts a lot of tourists. It is believed Jama Masjid was built on the site of an ancient Hindu temple. Thus the whole area near the Masjid is believed to be haunted. Locals do not visit here after sundown, as many natives have reported mysterious voices and extreme surroundings in the past.
