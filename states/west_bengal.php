                <p>This is a must-visit place if you are a bibliophile or an admirer of ancient architecture. However, amidst its books and beauty, the spooky incidents like the sound of footsteps from unidentified sources, the abnormal death of a student, the accident and tragic deaths of 12 workers during renovation make it India’s one of the most haunted places.  Even the security guards try to avoid the interiors of the library once after sunset.

                <p>It is not just men and women who apparently roam around as ghosts in Kolkata, but also horses. Such a spectacle locals claim to have seen at The Royal Calcutta Turf Club; a white horse (think Shadowfax) racing on the tracks under a full moon. The horse, it is supposed, is Pride, who belonged to a British horse racing enthusiast George Williams. It won its owner many races, and with it, immense fame and wealth. But, one day, it lost a race as it had gotten older. The next day, it was found dead on the track

                <p>As is clear by the name, Hastings House belonged to the first Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William (Bengal), Warren Hastings. Upon his return to England, he was impeached for several alleged misconducts, an event which was followed by seven years of trial, finally ending in his acquittal. The footsteps of his ghost are said to be head here; the spirit comes to the house in search of a folder, which supposedly contained papers that would have protected him against impeachment. Hastings House now serves as a college with students claiming to see an apparition on a horse.

                <p>Kolkata boasts of the world’s largest 19th-century cemetery outside of Europe and America. This cemetery, built in 1767, has a layered character of its own, which is yet to be comprehended entirely even by those who have visited this place during odd hours and experienced spine-chilling sounds and shadows creeping up on walls. Most of the graves here are of British soldiers, telling us that they haven’t entirely left their capital city yet.

                <p>Metro stations, especially the underground ones, are already eerie. Add to the mix reports of spirits and supernatural occurrences, and you probably want to go by car or bus. Rabindra Sadan Metro Station has been the scene of numerous suicides, and the spirits of victims are said to haunt the place. There have been reports of hazy figures passing through platform pillars and railway track; both commuters and train drivers have provided testament to this. Specifically, the last train which runs at midnight is said to be haunted.

                <p>Also known as Kidderpore Dock, Kolkata Dockyard was built by the Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah. His maritime trade with the East India Company ran quite successfully, until he was betrayed by the British. Now, his soul, they say, is back for revenge. Sailors and traders report seeing shadows doing rounds of the dockyard, supposedly of the Nawab, who wants revenge from the British for backstabbing him.

                <p>The Writer’s Building in Binoy Badal Dinesh Bagh is a place where the dead man apparently walks (not talking about The Undertaker). The person being mentioned is Captain Simpson of the East India Company, who was murdered here by revolutionaries during the struggle for independence. It is his ghost, which apparently walks here at night. Caretakers say that they heard shriek-like noises late in the night, even though the building is closed for people at 7:00 pm. No caretaker, it is claimed, has been able to continue his job for more than 24 hours!

                <p>The name itself does half the job of spooking people out! This century-old building built after British architecture gets its name from the dolls on the arches, which used to be the residence of rich landlords. The history behind this building and the reported screams of cry by female voices here stems from the fact that women were tortured here. Even though there are people who have made the ground floor of the building their home, even they advise against going up the stairs. It’s a spook-fest, to say the least.

                <p>Just down the road from Park Road Cemetery is Lower Circular Road Cemetery, another of the assumed ghostly places in the metropolis. Among the graves it contains is of a British government officer, named William Hay MacNaghten, who was killed and his body mutilated during the Anglo-Afghan War. His remains were brought by his wife, who then buried them here. It is said that if you narrate this story at his grave, the tree above it starts shivering. So, it seems that even nature weeps for this poor soul.

                <p>If you ever visit Kolkata, this building must be on your checklist. Its vast unique collection of dolls have never failed to make the tourists spellbound. This structure also belongs to the British era and currently serves as a vest knitting factory. Locals claim that ear-piercing laughter, sounds of bangles and footsteps are common in the house.

                <p>One of the most iconic sights of Kolkata, the Howrah Bridge is also said to be a haunt of ghosts. Talk to the wrestlers who train under it, and some of these might tell you that they regularly see arms merging from the Hooghly River, unsure whether they belong to a human or a spirit. Some people might also recall seeing a sobbing woman in white robes, calling out to them in a nasal voice. Those who have heard it or tried to approach the figure have claimed to be traumatised.
