        <p>Agrasen Ki Baoli (also known as Akshay Ki Baoli; transl.â€‰Baoli of Agrasen) is a 60-meter long and 15-meter
            wide historical stepwell in New Delhi, India.[1]

            Located on Hailey Road,[a][b] near Connaught Place, Jantar Mantar, it was designated a protected monument by
            the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains
            Act of 1958.

            Although there are no known historical records to prove who built the stepwell, it is believed that it was
            originally built by the legendary king Agrasen,[3] and the present architecture hints at it being rebuilt in
            the 14th century during the Tughlag or Lodi period of the Delhi Sultanate. The Baoli is open daily from 9 AM
            to 5:30 PM.
            This Baoli, with 108 steps, is among a few of its kind in Delhi. Three levels of the historic stepwell are
            visible. Each level is lined with arched niches on both sides. From an architectural perspective, this step
            well was probably rebuilt during the Tughlaq or Lodi period and is flanked by a small three-sided mosque
            towards the west.[11]The location has been used to shoot scenes from various Bollywood films such as the
            blockbuster film PK starring Aamir Khan and Sultan starring Salman Khan. It was also featured in the 2017
            Sridevi thriller Mom.[12][13] The step well also appeared on the second episode of The Amazing Race
            Australia 2 in 2012.[14]

            There are also urban legends of the step-well being haunted.[15][16][17][18]
            Agrasen ki Baoli is quite famous for urban legends of hauntings and incidents. Many people consider it to be
            haunted and it has been the centre of many paranormal activities. Legend has it that the reservoir was once
            filled with mystical dark waters that compelled people to jump in to commit suicide. In the more modern
            times, it is said that the place casts an evil spell on visitors that stay over at this destination after
            dusk. The presence of several nocturnal beings such as bats and owls only elevate the bizarre quotient of
            this place. Haunted or not, these happenings do make up for interesting stories and make this destination
            even more intriguing.</p>
