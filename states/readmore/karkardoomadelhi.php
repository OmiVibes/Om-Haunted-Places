            The News Minute| September 25, 2014| 08.27 am IST Those who have watched the Paranormal Activity movie
            series could very well relate to the recent going-ons in a certain Delhi court complex. Every courthouse has
            its usual visitors of lawyers, criminals, accused and a large flank of police officials. One court in Delhi,
            the Karkardooma Court Complex, however, has generated huge public interest, because of recent mysterious
            activities happening every night – of paranormal and quite certainly ghost-like activities. A video of grabs
            taken from different CCTV cameras showing spooky unexplainable events occurring in the office rooms at night
            has gone viral even though many believe it is not a video from the Karkardooma Court at all. The video going
            viral is in fact on YouTube as a video from an office in Manchester. The video switches from one CCTV camera
            to the next and slowly spooky events begin to occur. A chair whizzes past computer terminals , draws in
            cupboards open up and suddenly papers are seen being scattered across rooms with no explanation whatsoever.
            These paranormal sightings have been going on for a few years, but the intensity of occurrences has
            increased claim many who frequent this court. Deepak Dalmiya, a journalist working with Aaj Tak spent six
            nights in the Karkardooma Court Complex to find out if the ghost stories were indeed true. Saying that it
            was something he had never seen before, he told The News Minute,” I didn’t believe in ghosts before. After
            going there, I think they do exist.” Deepak's video shows a circular light moving across the library and
            reaching the computers , after which they all switch on . Shahdara Bar Council joint secretary Raman Sharma
            at Kakardooma Court said that a white shadowy silhouette appears and switches on all computers, said an IANS
            report. Another senior lawyer claimed to have seen a ghost in his own chamber. Another reporter Raj Kinkar
            working in New Delhi on the other hand couldn’t decide if it was ghosts or some unexplainable mystery
            occurring every night at the court. “A collective light moves from the library door towards the rows of
            terminals and immediately all the computers switch on,” he said about the strange occurrences in the
            courthouse. An office boy who worked there told Kinkar that he switched off the computers every night. “But
            they were on in the mornings whenever he returned,“ Kinkar said. Kinkar had another alternative reason for
            the strange occurrences. “It could be possible that hackers are accessing the computers here,” he said.
            “Sometimes records, challans are all stored on these computers. They are valuable data. It could be
            unethical hacking,” he said. It could possibly be a hacking challenge that someone has taken up, he
            hypothesized. This could be true, but it is hardly any explanation for the unexplained movements in the
            office rooms of the court house. The increase in the ghostly sightings has resulted in a number of changes.
            Work winds up soon by 5 pm as no one wants to linger after that time and even guards do not enter the
            premises after rumours of ghosts started floating around. No one seems to know what is happening, but those
            in the Karkardooma Court house are still apprehensive about what really goes on at the court.
