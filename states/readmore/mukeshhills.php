        <p>On a dark and moonless night, the ruined facade of Mukesh Mills with its minar-like defunct chimney is an
            eerie reminder of the Mumbai that was Bombay. The inky night sky shows through its blackened window arches,
            a gap-toothed, otherworldly blotch on an otherwise modern metropolis.

            It’s been decades since Colaba’s landmark Mukesh Mills fell into disrepair following a fire but images of
            its destroyed roofs, moss-encrusted walls and windows pop up even today on all of “Mumbai’s most haunted”
            lists. The mill compound has been shut since 2019 after the BMC issued a notice stating its structures have
            grown far too weak. Yet, rumours say the mill remains occupied…of tenants of the otherworldly kind. These
            “ghosts” are believed to still float through its empty corridors. And humans who have happened to walk in
            the mill compound have often borne witness to unexplained phenomena like strange sounds, echoing footsteps
            and moving shadows.
            While the original owners couldn’t have predicted the mill’s collapse, that followed by its unlikely
            popularity would have been even more baffling. Long abandoned to the elements, this atmospheric ruin found a
            second life on screen. And its real walls became the stuff of fantasies on reel. From choreographed song and
            dance set pieces to action-packed film climaxes, Mukesh Mills became a favourite among Bollywood location
            scouts especially in the 1990s. Several Hindi films—from the iconic “Jumma Chumma” song in the Amitabh
            Bachchan starrer Hum to the high-octane action sequences in the Pooja Bhat-Sanjay Dutt starrer Sadak, to
            more recent films like Tiger Shroff’s action debut Heropanti—have been shot at the derelict mill. Portions
            of Shahrukh Khan’s superhit film Om Shanti Om were also shot here, a film that coincidentally happened to
            involve a villain named Mukesh and a burned-down and haunted film set. And if you look closely enough at the
            frames of all of the above, you will be able to spot the broken staircases, shattered windows, rusting
            machinery and dilapidated roofs that are distinct markers of Mukesh Mills.
            Claims around Mukesh Mills remain unverified and anecdotal and the site is now shut for shoots or visitors.
            Unlike most other mills in the city, which were eventually redeveloped and have become home to some of
            Mumbai’s best restaurants and cafes, Mukesh Mills remains largely untouched. Umrigar says it is the presence
            of a naval helicopter base next door, which prevents redevelopment. Popular belief about the hauntings
            persist and whatever be the case we wouldn’t recommend that you go wandering within its dark walls at night!
