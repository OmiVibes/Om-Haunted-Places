            Do you believe in negative energy? Do you believe there is an unexplained side to this world that appears
            after the sun goes down? Well, the world is certainly full of places that are surrounded with mysteries that
            we have not found answers to. One such place is the infamous Khooni Nadi in the national capital Delhi, a
            place that remains busy and crowded all the time yet might succeed in making you jittery. The name in itself
            is quite spooky and I cannot even imagine how will it be to visit a place with such an ominous
            identity?Yet,let’s try and unearth the truth behind the existence of this mysterious stream that flows in
            the Rohini region of West Delhi.
            This small stream can be seen flowing in the west Delhi region near Rohini district. Circled with green
            trees and vegetation, this stream is believed to be haunted if you ask the locals living near the area. As
            per the residents, they have noticed several unusual happenings and mysterious incidents here that are best
            left unexplained. Though there’s not much proof of the place being haunted, it does scare people living in
            the area. Despite blessed with such greenery, you’ll rarely find any human in the area. It’s because people
            are scared of roaming around or near this stream too.
            People believe that if anybody touches the water of Khooni Nadi, the stream sucks that person in! Locals
            also believe that there have been several such incidents in the past, where people have drowned in this
            rather small stream. Though none of these deaths are associated with ghost happenings; they are considered
            to be suicides. Yet, the common belief says that all the deceased come back as ghosts, haunting the stream
            and nearby area from decades now.
            Residents also claim that they have heard sounds of screaming and crying near the stream after it gets all
            dark. One startling fact to notice here is the rather abysmal depth of this stream, yet the high number of
            drowning accidents.
            Visit Khooni Nadi only if you are on a quest for solving mysteries surrounding ghosts. Our suggestion is to
            beware and not visit it alone or after dark. Ghosts or not, the place has seen many deaths and is best kept
            some distance from.
