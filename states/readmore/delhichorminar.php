            Chor Minar or 'Tower of Thieves' is a 13th-century minaret with 225 holes,[1] situated just off Aurobindo
            Marg in the Hauz Khas area, in New Delhi.[2][3] The Chor Minar is nearly 700 to 800 years old.[4] it's also
            situated in narnaul Haryana near dhosi hills 120 km away from Delhi
            It was built under the rule of Alauddin Khalji,[5] of the Khalji dynasty (1290–1320) in the thirteenth
            century.[6] Historians suggests that the Khalji king slaughtered a settlement of Mongol people, nearby, to
            stop them from joining with their brethren in another Mongol settlement in Delhi, the present day locality
            of 'Mongolpuri'.

            During the raid of Ali Beg, Tartaq and Targhi (1305), 8,000 Mongol prisoners were executed and their heads
            displayed is the towers around Siri[7]
            According to local legends, it was a 'tower of beheading', where the severed heads of thieves were displayed
            on spear through its 225 holes, to act as a deterrent to thieves.[2][8] In case the heads exceeded the
            number of holes, the less important heads were piled in a pyramid outside the tower.
            As we made our way towards the circular park, a chill swept through the air. The stories of torso-less
            ghosts amid graveyards spoke voluminous about the minaret that was to follow.

            Surrounded by a thick canopy of trees and residential houses, the half-ruined structure stood tall. Facing
            the tests of time as if a candle flame flickering across the sight of the moon.

            Our heart thudded loud at its sight. The stench of bat and creatures of the night filled its stairway.
            Facing us with an amplified silence stood the haunted Chor Minar.
            Chor Minar or the tower of thieves, is a 13th-century minaret with 225 holes, located near Aurobindo Marg
            (near Chausath Khmba) in the Hauz Khas area, New Delhi. It was built and constructed under the rule of
            Alauddin Khilji of the Khilji dynasty and resembles a combination of Parsi and Indian architectural style.
            According to local legends, during the reign of Alauddin Khilji, severed heads of thieves were displayed and
            exhibited on spear through its 225 holes, to act as a deterrent. Serving it a nickname- “the tower of
            beheading”.
            As the story goes, this reign of Delhi Sultanate is also marked as an epoch in the history of Delhi. It is
            recorded that during the raid of Ali Beg, Tartaq and Targhi (the year 1305), a Mongol colony comprising of
            8,000 Mongol prisoners was executed and their heads displayed in the towers around Siri.
            This minaret, the half-ruined ghostly tower to the left of the Delhi- Qutub road, is believed to be the
            existing structure from that tragedy.

            Today the tower lies in a tattered condition, enclosed in a park within a housing colony. While similar
            structures remain destroyed in the grand of time, however, the surrounding serves a bit of silence, probably
            a reminder of the horrors of death that once served this place.
