        <p>Warren Hastings is a name etched in Indian history. He was Bengal’s first governor-general, between 1773 and
            1785 CE. Located within the Belvedere Estate at 20, BJC Road, Alipore, Kolkata-700027, Belvedere House is
            where Warren Hastings lived till the 1780s, as per reports. His mansion in Kolkata still bears with it the
            mark of history, legends and even spooky stories!
            Warren Hastings’ house is also known as one of the most haunted places in Kolkata. The house has dominated
            public conversation for several decades, with numerous stories of supernatural sightings. Legends state that
            Warren Hastings’ ghost still returns to his former home, seeking valuables that were reportedly misplaced
            upon his shifting to England. As per local lore, a carriage drawn by four horses has been sighted,
            approaching the building, on several nights. Some feel the spirit and presence of Hastings while others hear
            footsteps rushing towards the upper floor before vanishing altogether. This is one out of two prominent
            legends, the second one revolving around the ghost of a young boy.
            The ghost of the young boy often appears in the middle of the grounds, as per several people. Legend has it
            that there was a group of boys playing football here and one of them died instantly, when the ball hit him
            on the chest. His friends ran away, in a state of panic. Many people have admitted hearing voices of
            children on the grounds, while some have claimed seeing the boy in the garden, waiting for his companions to
            come back. Another ghost is that of a white horse. The building was once home to a horse owner who
            especially loved his white horse. It died one night after being shot by someone. It is believed that the
            spirit of this horse still roams about and can be spotted on some nights before vanishing.
