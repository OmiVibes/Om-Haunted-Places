        <p>Thinking of hopping in the car and heading for a drive to the Sinhagad Fort? Well, hold that thought and tell
            us did you know that your favourite spot is actually haunted? Yes, you read it right, people. So, drop
            everything and start reading now!
            arish ho rahi hai? Sinhagad chalen? Trekking ka mood hai? Sinhagad chalen? Weekend is approaching. Sinhagad
            chalen? Sinhagad is to Punekars what chai is to Indians. Am I right? Other than being one of the most iconic
            spots around Pune, this fort also offers a spectacular view of the Sahyadris and the city because of being
            situated at a height of 700 m above the sea level. But did you know that this magnificent fort is actually
            haunted and has many incidents to prove the same?
            According to hearsay, the fort is haunted and is said to be the home of ghosts of soldiers who died in the
            many wars that happened at this fort. Locals of the area vouch that they have heard spine-chilling war cries
            coming from the fort at wee hours.
            Another anecdote that has been floating around is that ghosts of children who died in an accident when their
            bus crashed down from the hill also haunt the fort. This incident is relatively recent and it is said that a
            few years back, a bus full of school children met with an accident after the driver lost control at a blind
            turn near the fort and everyone on board died. Eerie activities have been observed on the exact spot of the
            accident where the bus fell off the cliff. Some even claim that they have seen children standing close to
            the accident spot and getting vanished in seconds when one approaches closer (why anyone would approach a
            ghost is beyond our understanding). Can you feel the heebie-jeebies yet? Cos we surely can.
            So, next time you’re at Sinhagad Fort, do let us know if you too feel a cold air or probably a ghost for
            real in the comment section below.
            PS: Don’t look behind, there might be a child clad in white standing right behind you, you never know right!
