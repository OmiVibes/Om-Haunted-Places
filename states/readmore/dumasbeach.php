        <p>Who doesn’t like listening to stories that have a hint of drama, a touch of thrill and hundreds of ghosts in
            them? One such terror tale is related to the Dumas Beach in Gujarat that many must not be aware of! When it
            comes to most haunted places in India, generally Bhangarh and Kuldhara (in Rajasthan) and Agrasen ki Baoli
            in Delhi cover the prime spots on the list. However, the story of Dumas Beach is equally realistic and
            haunting.
            While this beach must look like God’s home during the day time, it becomes devil’s paradise after the sun
            goes down. One of the premium tourist attractions in Surat, this beach is visited by hordes of travellers
            and tourist every day but as it starts getting dark, people leave the place for better good. And those who
            tried to challenge the beach by staying overnight, they either never came back or had worst experiences to
            share.
            The mystery surrounding the Dumas Beach
            Located along the Arabian Sea, Dumas Beach is considered one of the most haunted places in Gujarat. The
            beach is renowned for two things, one for its black sand and other for being haunted! It is said that Dumas
            Beach was once used as a Hindu burial ground and hence is possessed by several haunting spirits that never
            left the region. Folklore explains that the existence of black sand is because of amount of ash created by
            burning the dead which got mixed with white sand of the beach and turned dark in shade.
            There’s no denying that the beach has an eerie feel to it. The surroundings are beautiful but hauntingly
            depressing, and you cannot escape the negativity that surrounds the place. A number of paranormal activities
            have been reported in the area after the moon shows up. If reports are to be believed, several tourists and
            locals have gone missing from Surat’s haunted beach, Dumas. Also, a man was found dead on the beach with his
            tongue popping out. And there is absolutely no one who could explain the reason behind all these mishaps.
            People also claim that they heard weird sounds coming from the beach, like people laughing and someone
            crying, even when there’s not a single soul present. Not only this, locals also say that they have witnessed
            white apparitions and moving orbs along with myriad other mysterious activities that can’t be explained.
            Reaching Dumas Beach is quite easy as there are various ways of getting here. The beach is located at a
            distance of around 20 km from Surat city and it takes just half an hour to get here. A number of local
            transports are available from the city for Dumas Beach.
