            he Mutiny Memorial, now known as Ajitgarh, is a memorial situated on the Ridge New Delhi.[1][2] It was built
            in memory of all those who had fought in the Delhi Field Force, British and Indian, during the Indian Revolt
            of 1857.[
            Erected by the Public Works Department at government expense in 1863 the memorial was hastily designed and
            constructed. It received much public criticism on completion. In 1972, the 25th anniversary of India's
            Independence, the Indian Government renamed the monument 'Ajitgarh' ('Place of the Unvanquished') and
            erected a plaque stating that the 'enemy' mentioned on the memorials were 'immortal martyrs for Indian
            freedom'.[4]
            The memorial was built in the Gothic style in red sandstone, with four tiers rising from an octagonal base.
            The lowest tier consists of seven faces containing memorial plaques and one face holding the stairs to the
            upper tiers.[5]
            The memorial was built to be just taller than the Ashoka Pillar, which is situated 200 metres (660 ft)
            away.[6]
            The Mutiny Memorial is located in front of Old Telegraph Building, Kashmiri Gate. you can entre in the
            memorial by the entrance gate opposite to Bara Hindu Rao Hospital, near to Delhi University campus in New
            Delhi.
