        <p>Signature Farm is one of the most haunted place situated in Ahmedabad. Now this place is often visited by
            those who dare to worry. It is in Ahmedabad, where the courtyard is full of statues and broken statues.
            Admittedly, some statues of Mahatma Gautam and the horse are erected vertically and in the middle.

            There are no people or communication networks. According to CXChinese, the local population has long been
            the cause of the rural massacre. And since then, the soul has wandered in this place.

            This cozy place in Ahmedabad is not known to many people, but many people come here often to experience
            extraordinary activities. This place is known as Ahmedabad place in Ahmedabad.



            The courtyard is filled with dilapidated statues and Buddha statues, as well as horse sculptures, which
            appear to have been drawn vertically from the center. Villagers are believed to have been killed in this
            place for many years. It is said that the souls of the villagers killed in the massacre still exist around
            the village.
