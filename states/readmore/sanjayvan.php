            Sanjay Van is a sprawling city forest area near Vasant Kunj and Mehrauli in Delhi, India. It is spread over
            an area of 443 acres. It is one of the most thickly wooded areas of the cityâ€™s green lungs.
            The forest, which is part of the Mehrauli South Central Ridge, has undergone severe degradation in recent
            times with the proliferation of the Prosopis juliflora tree which is non-endemic to the Aravalli Ranges and
            has caused depletion of the ground water level, killing native flora and changing the natural soil
            characteristics of the Aravallis. Sewage water and effluent which is discharged into Sanjay Van has also
            affected this green belt in the Capital.
            Amid a growing demand from nature lovers, the forest is going to be made a bird sanctuary. The Sanjay Van,
            which is presently undergoing restoration through a unique collaborative effort between the Delhi
            Development Authority and a citizen's group, may well serve as a model that will be replicated to restore
            other ridges in the capital.
            Apart from heritage, the area is one of the few recluses for bird watchers and nature enthusiasts. Resident
            or visiting birds include the Indian peafowl, grey heron, Eurasian golden oriole, purple sunbird, Asian
            koel, Brahminy starling, Indian silverbill, grey-breasted prinia, crested honey buzzard, white-throated
            kingfisher, rufous treepie, Indian paradise flycatcher, Eurasian sparrowhawk, red-wattled lapwing, cattle
            egret, common moorhen, white-breasted waterhen, grey francolin and the Jacobin cuckoo, a migrant from Africa
            that breeds in this forest.

            The forest also conserves natural habitat for the nilgai, golden jackal, snakes and a large variety of
            butterflies.
            As the land is a part of Aravalli Range it shows all the characteristics of the same. Some areas have flat
            lands some have uphills and downhills. The whole area is full of big giant rocks forming a small hill every
            here and there. It has got some small drains spreading all over the areas which can be seen in every 300-400
            meters of a walk. Overall we can say it has got a terrain of forest and hills.
            There are multiple entry and exit points, but the ones at the Qutub Institutional Area and Neela Hauz Bridge
            near Vasant Kunj provide the easiest access and least confusion. Visitors are advised to wear shoes and
            full-length trousers as protection against the thorny shrubbery, and to take sufficient fluids and snacks,
            as there is no kiosk or shop in the quiet of the woods.There are multiple entry and exit points, but the
