        <p>Ruins of a 14th-century hunting lodge that is believed by some to be haunted.[1] It is situated in the busy
            market of Karol Bagh. A huge statue of Lord Hanuman can be seen on the road which serves as a landmark in
            Karol Bagh. People identify the nearby areas from the statue. Bagga Link is adjacent to this statue and
            behind this Bagga Link there is a silent road which takes you to the Southern Ridge of Delhi. Bhuli
            Bhatiyari Ka Mahal was built by Firuz Shah Tughlaq in the 14th century. Sources say that it was basically a
            hunting lodge during the reign of Firuz Shah Tughlaq. The entrance of Bhuli Bhatiyari Ka Mahal is made up of
            stones and a big gate can be noticed in the front. And there is another small door which ends into a big
            open courtyard.
            Someone rightly said: “Stare at the dark too long and you will eventually see what isn’t there.” Rings true
            for most of the places that are haunted. One such place is Bhuli Bhatiyari Ka Mahal at Jhandewalan near
            Karol Bagh. I had come across several articles, videos and social media posts about the place being haunted.
            Some said that this place is so spooky, no guard has been able to work here for more than one day. And that
            screams of women and children as if they were getting beaten up can be heard at this spot. You will find
            several stories about the place on Internet.

            One story says that inside the mahal lives a queen who had died 600 years ago, and that her ghost is seen
            here at night. Another says a person named Boo Ali Bakhtiyari ruled here, and the place was named after him
            and later people modified the name to Bhooli Bhatyari for theease of pronunciation. Another says that a
            woman named Bhuri from the Bhatiyar tribe in Rajasthan, lost her way and reached this palace. One day,
            Muslim ruler Sultan Feroz Shah Tughlaq came here.He was thirsty, so she offered him water and he named the
            place after her name, and since she had forgotten her way, it was named Bhooli Bhatiyari. When Bhuri died,
            she possessed this place. But if the historians are to be believed this was built in the 13th century by
            Tughl aqasa hunting lodge. Bhooli Bhatiyari Ka Mahal is under the Arc h a e o - logical Survey of India and
            currently being restored. People still come here in huge numbers, expecting to meet the ghost.

            Intrigued by these stories, visited this place at different time of the night several times in February
            2020, with my assistant Yogi who takes care of imagery tools like night vision cameras, thermal cameras, SLS
            cameras, full spect rum l ight s and other equipment. It’s not a big palace, not a fort, but more of small
            house, with a few rooms, a lawn, and two gates for entry and exit. When I went there, there was no heavy
            police deployment at night as mentioned on the social media.There are just police barricades, and you are
            not allowed to enter at night; not because of the ghost but due to the risk of animals or anti-social
            elements. There was also guard on duty, working here for four years now, who told me that nothing has ever
            happened to him. And that busted another myth. Once, I left my night vision there for three hours, and I
            thought if there’s anything I will get the footage. I even performed planchette (an ancient technique to
            instigate the paranormal energy, if any), but got nothing.

            I realised that all these ghost tales were imaginary. Next time, anyone tells you not to visit Bhuli
            Bhatiyari, you know what to say. Though you are not allowed to stay there at night, you can with permission
            from the police, like I did. As told to Nikita Sharma by Jay Alani, Paranormal Investigator, media
            professional, author, TedX speaker, podcaster and founder of the Paranormal Company
