            Rabindra Sarobar is a station of the Kolkata Metro.[1][2][3] It is situated on Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road
            at Charu Chandra Avenue in Charu Market, Tollygunge. The station is named after Rabindra Sarobar, an
            artificial lake and the surrounding area of South Kolkata. It is followed by the station Mahanayak Uttam
            Kumar towards Kavi Subhash and is preceded by Kalighat station towards Noapara and Dum Dum.
            Once I had faced a spooky feeling, rather I have seen something unnatural in the last metro from rabindra
            sarobar. It was a rainy night, I was returning from my tuition at Netaji metro station. I was late and I am
            in a hurry to return home safely. I was in a non ac metro and it was the last metro of the day, I was
            sitting at the 3rd last compartment.

            When the metro entered the Rabindra sarobar station, there were only 2 to 3 commuters who were waiting for
            the train, no one boarded in my compartment except a man wearing a raincoat. His face was covered with a
            mask and he was about 6 ft tall.

            He went walking to the last compartment and stood in front of the gate. After the train departs from the
            station, when it was on its way towards the tunnel, the man in the last compartment tried to open the door
            with his hands and jumped outside in the tunnel, the door automatically shuts down after the man jumps from
            a moving metro.

            It was a scary nightmare for me, and this incident occured in the mid of 2018.

            I still feels goosebumps when I think about that incident
