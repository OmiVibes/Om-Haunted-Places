        <p>The lush green Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai is one of the most visited attractions of the city.
            People visit this park and explore it on rented cycles or on foot. The Kanehri Caves with their rock-cut
            structures and the rich flora and fauna of the national park are some of its popular attractions. But even
            though Sanjay Gandhi National Park is thronged by nature lovers every day, it also has a haunted tale that
            is whispered in hushed tones.
            The park is believed to be haunted by the ghosts of people who lost their lives here due to animal attacks.
            One such ghost is that of a woman hitchhiker who is dressed in an all-white attire. She asks people to give
            her a ride and then disappears. People avoid going to the national park in the evening as the darkness falls
            not just for the fear of animals, but also the spirits lurking here. Some have claimed to hear strange
            voices while some have had an eerie feeling of being followed or constantly looked at.
            The night guards who work at Sanjay Gandhi National Park are no strangers to the spirits roaming here and
            tourists often ask them to narrate ghost stories theyâ€™ve heard or witnessed. So, if you are planning to
            visit this national park, we advise you to go during the day when unless you are brave enough to face
            whatever lies in it and comes alive at night.
