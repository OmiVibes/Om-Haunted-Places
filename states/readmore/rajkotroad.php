        <p>While talking about the haunted places in Rajkot, this place will be on the top of the list. Actually,
            Bagodara is a hamlet on NH-8A that connects Rajkot and Ahmedabad, making it one of the most haunted places
            in Gujarat. On this stretch, between Bagodara and Limdi, lots of accidents take place. While many people
            believe it as a coincidence, the locals believe something different. According to them, this place is
            haunted by the spirit of a woman.

            Even, the night-time drivers also said that they had witnessed a fishy image of a woman on the road and
            whenever the car gets closer, she vanishes. People believe such incident is responsible for so many
            accidents. There is also a report that people have seen women and beggars on the street who just disappear
            whenever the cars come closer.

            They have felt an eerie silence at this place and something unusual in the nature that gives them
            spine-chilling experience at night. If you want to experience a long drive on this road at night, do it at
            your own risk and be very careful.

            Final words

            So, these two are the most haunted places in Rajkot that you can happily avoid or visit at your own risk.
            The haunted incidents are not like any show or anything that you can experience whenever you are there.

            If you are lucky (or unlucky?), you can experience something. But, the eeriness in nature will definitely be
            felt there. Apart from these places, there are lots of other haunted places in Gujarat which are believed to
            have real haunted incidents, experienced by many.
