        <p>Mahim have a series of haunted places, but the creepiest weird place among them is Nasserwanj Wadi. Not so
            far from the Mahim railway station, Nasserwanj Wadi is already known as one of the scariest places of
            Mumbai. Trying to explore the place after midnight is definitely not a good idea. The painful spirit of the
            landlord is still haunting on the place every night.
            The story is almost 16 years old. This property was owned then by a Parsi gentleman, named Naseer. For some
            reason he was killed in his own cabin. He was brutally burnt by the murders. Near his chamber there was a
            well in the compound. Due, to love and affection towards his property ghost didn't leave that place. People
            there believed he haunts people who crossed his path at night. At many times the victims were possessed by
            the ghost. The property is believed as cursed by the presence of the eerie presence. More than seven people
            died unnaturally within a short span of time after Nasserâ€™s death. Residents there thought the ghost walks
            around the well. They concealed the well under a pole. That really didn't work for them. Only now they
            remain cautious especially at night. They don't go near the well at night in any circumstances.
